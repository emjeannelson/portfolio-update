	 	 	<h2>2005</h2>
			<p>
			Earned my degree in philosophy from Columbia University. I majored in philosophy because I loved the exhilarating “click” I felt as the abstract concepts underlying the human experience came together in my mental map of the world. I learned how powerful the ability to easily manipulate those concepts and explain them to others with clarity and precision really is. And, I studied symbolic logic, <a href="http://www.philosophy-index.com/logic/symbolic">the method of representing logical expressions through the use of symbols and variables, rather than in ordinary language</a>. Most college students had only recently started using email in their daily lives, and I didn’t yet realize that my love of logical expressions and operations could be an asset in the new digital world.

	 	 	<h2>2010</h2>
			<p>
			Earned my JD from New York University School of Law. In undergrad, I had gotten a taste of formal training in in rigorous, systematic thinking and conceptual reasoning, and I wanted more. I learned to analyze complex situations involving massive amounts of information, interrogate the assumptions underlying big ideas, construct strong arguments, and communicate effectively and persuasively. As for becoming a lawyer … let’s just say that once you see how the sausage gets made, you can’t unsee it. I was left with an urge to somehow make the world better.

	 	 	<h2>2010-2012</h2>
			<p>
			Worked in fundraising and organizational strategy for education-related nonprofits. As someone who loves to learn and believes education is the key to a better world, I was happy to lend my communication and problem-solving skills to the task of ensuring that all kids receive the high-quality education they deserve. I also enjoyed using digital tools to create online programming for students across the country who wanted to improve their argumentation skills.

	 	 	<h2>2013-2016</h2>
			<p>
			Found myself in Taipei, Taiwan (!) charged with teaching high schoolers from diverse cultural backgrounds to think, write, and talk about how we know what we know, and what we ought to do about it, as an IB Theory of Knowledge and IB Philosophy teacher at an elite private prep school. My time as a teacher was a two-year-long exploration of what it really means to think critically, as my students and I examined how features of human psychology like memory, emotion, and rationality, as well as social, cultural, and historical factors, work together to construct our “mental maps” of the world.

	 	 	<h2>Today</h2>
			<p>
			I use my training and experience in how to identify and understand problems, brainstorm and vet solutions, and communicate even complex ideas and processes in terms anyone can understand to build awesome things for the web. As a student in the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree, I'm still a beginner, but I'm learning more every day. I bring a philosophy nerd’s enthusiasm, a lawyer’s systematic approach, and a teacher’s understanding of cognitive psychology to the process of creating thoughtful, user-centered, delightful web experiences. I’m a freelancer and a digital nomad, currently based in my favorite hometown of all time, Taipei.
